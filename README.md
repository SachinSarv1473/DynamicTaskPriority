# DynamicTaskPriority

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system capable of dynamically adjusting the priority order of tasks in real-time. By doing so, users gain the ability to respond to real-time factors and manually reorganize task priorities, ensuring optimal decision-making in the current scenario.

This project is developed to be simulated on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) and utilizes its hardware & libraries for running.

## Hardware and Components
- ESP32 Processor
- Keypad
- Breadboard
- LED
- Wires


## Technology Stack
This project leverages the power of the ESP32 processor and relies on the FreeRTOS real-time operating system along with its libraries. FreeRTOS is a widely used platform for managing lower-level components on microprocessors like ESP32 and plays a crucial role in task handling throughout the project.
